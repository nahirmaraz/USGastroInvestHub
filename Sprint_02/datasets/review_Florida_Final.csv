What's wrong everything ...
Tried 3 pumps, all accepted card, gave instructions to pump as normal, but wouldn't function, no indication why. Nothing pumped, but gave $0.00 receipt, moved to another pump, same experience. Went inside, extremely poor English, out of Regular, doesn't know if other stations in the area. No signs or other notices posted, asked why, told too much trouble, nothing to use to post.
Back out, tried ""Plus"", pumped $0.67 worth in 3 minutes.
Finally pumped the ""93 high octane"" ok but paid $8 more than the regular that was needed.
Pumps also in poor repair. Pump ""on"" latches worn out. Shall I keep going?

108491801367044304954,Summer Adams,2,I went to this store for a snack for my 2 year old daughter and for some gas. When I came in everything was okay. my daughter got her chips and we went to the counter. She saw the candy wanted it like most 2 year olds would. I had to try to calm her and tell her the guy already rang up the chips and he was quite impatient with us. I had to pay with ebt for the food. A lady came in after me and paid for 20 in gas. I had to get back in line after her to pay for gas separately on my debit card. I told the cashier I wanted 5.98 and what pump to put it on. He questioned me why I chose to put that little in gas. I had to tell him that's all I had in my bank account and i'm a student. I felt really uncomfortable there and the cashier was invasive and impatient.,0x88e71333eead20eb:0xb496b4d5e14f690d,2018-07-25,18:32:00,1

Doesn't matter how many employees are working, there is Always only 1 running a register. The others are always too busy talking on their cell phones or standing outside smoking. No matter what day of the week, or time of day... You ALWAYS have to stand in line for 15 minutes to check out. Doesn't matter if you're only trying to buy gas, or a fountain drink or just a pack of cigarettes the line is ALWAYS clean back to the beer cooler. If you need to stop for something in a hurry..... DO NOT stop here. The ONLY good thing about this store is Miss Freida. She's a gem! The minute another gas station moves into our area...

111553297017544104701,Andi Chesson,1,"Okay everybody get ready for this one. I've done several reviews and I'm so honest about how I feel with the places I've been into because customer service is an extremely important subject for me. Nowadays it is a luxury to be able to go anywhere and spend your money whether it's food you doing laundry you're going to find some shoes from a local convenience store such as this Circle K on Nebraska and 124th. I've been going to the Circle K for several several years at least the past 20 years, I really never had a problem with the employees that work there but I recently acquired a home around this area and so now this is my convenience local convenience store. Unfortunately there is a young lady that works there that really does not need to be working there. I understand people have bad days you know not everyday is a good day I understand that, if it's more than just a few days or one day ask for leave of absence and get your life together. Do these people not understand that we expect to have at least a hello or smile when you walk in the door!!! Hello,we're getting ready to spend our hard-earned money? I really am disappointed with the stock in that store as well, once again this place is a multimillion-dollar corporation, why can't they keep certain things that people buy all the time stocked on the shelves? it just does not make sense to me it's not like the Reps from these food companies aren't going to bring them more when they run out, especially if it's  something that they sell a lot of. Oh and also one more thing before I exit this review I came in here about a week ago to ask for some change ask the young lady when she finishes her transaction and has the door open when she mind giving me dollars in exchange for 8 quarters that I had she told me no we can't do that. Okay that maybe their policy I understand but thing is that I was in there the week before and there was no problem with one of the other employees that was there. Just seems to be this young lady needs to find another type of job to work at because as people can see I have no problem telling the truth.

116254225740720144146,Brianna C.,1,I have had then”pleasure” of utilizing suburban propane for the past three years in a house that I rent. I unfortunately have no choice in the company and I’m pretty sure they know this. Every time I get a fill the price is different than the price I’m quoted on the phone. SIGNIFICANTLY different. Customer care on the corporate side is great until they transfer you to the local office. Then they promise you call backs to discuss the bill and you never hear back until they want your money and still don’t want to discuss the over charge. I have been double billed for days I never even had a fill and had to pull camera footage from my house. They are thieves!,0x88c2f0972b40bc7b:0xd1e1c13ac626ac5b,2020-09-21,14:01:07,3

Paid for a full tank of gas and went in to get a couple of beers for Saint Patty‘s day to celebrate with my girlfriend at home. I had my 16-year-old son with me who is taller than me who walked into the cooler with me to go look at the Gatorade‘s and Kathy refused to sell me the beer. Another customer in line was saying “there’s chocolate milk in there too“. I understand the law, there was nothing posted whatsoever that he could not go into the cooler with me, and being treated like some criminal is not really a way to get business. I would also advise against hiring miserable people who want to take it out on their customers because they probably made bad decisions their whole life.

106528400863736726938,Gary Griffith,1,"I get better performance and mileage out of their 90 octane non-ethanol gas  than anywhere else. But I need to find a new supplier. 90% of the time the pay at the pump feature is not working. Or it works and it won't print a receipt. This says just one thing, the owner/management does not care if they keep customers or not. I prefer to pay at the pump. I do not like having to walk over to the store, stand in line, be exposed to people and their possible germs. And if you pay inside you have to guess how much gas you need. You either don't get enough or you have to go inside again to get a credit on the difference. Paying at the pump I am in and out. At this joint a simple fill up can take 30 minutes or more. Not worth it. Going to buy my gas elsewhere. Not an isolated incident, it's a regular inconvenience. Just cost you a customer for good.",0x88c2e3e601be1a13:0xdf74578b4cebd120,2021-01-12,14:13:20,1

I said Hi to Taylor to which I got no response, she was too busy discussing a procedure on what to do when you are closing out your drawer and forget to get more $5 bills with the other cashier that forgot to get more $5. When she was done with the other cashier she still didn't even bother to look at me or in my direction. I don't know but maybe she's afraid of dogs cause I had my very scary 4lb service dog with me. As she rang up my items I felt like I was an inconvenience to her and as I counted my money to pay her I felt like I didn't do it fast enough and omg I think she was trying to push my dime change thru my hand. and then she garbled something to me and pushed my bag of items toward me, I couldn't wait to leave.

Put on hold for 10 minutes and Andrew told me I need to send the paperwork again. They also couldn’t find my account after Andrew put the info in their system. They were higher priced than Ferrel. Wanted to buy local. He was extremely rude and told me how good of reviews they have. I am glad they consider 2.3 stars good. I don’t like reviewing negative if I can help it but this company deserves it.,0x88db44784a53fc27:0xd518395dada1f100,2019-11-14,17:54:13,1
105926221953827988366,Lori Wisniewski,5,"I chose Suburban Gas because their price for identical installation of new service was less than half that of another local company and because I'd read good reviews of their services. I was not disappointed. While the permit process was lengthy in my city, as soon as SP received it, they called and scheduled the install.

Their installers, Marc and Walter, are great guys - polite, courteous, timely,  neat - and even put up with my annoying dogs as they came in and out of my house the day of rough in. The guys cleaned up their worksite and were always on time. They were truly a pleasure to have around while they were here.

My final install had a hiccup when we realized my stove didn't come with a conversion kit and I had to order it and wait another week for them to come finish it up. But that again, was not on them. When they had everything they needed, Walter came back and finished up the install. They really were fantastic.

Maria in the office is equally helpful and friendly. We had another extended issue getting the permit signed off and Maria was all over it until it was resolved. Always accessible and knowledgeable
about the process, she is a great asset to SP.

I highly recommend Suburban Gas to anyone looking to add this service.",0x88db44784a53fc27:0xd518395dada1f100,2019-09-19,12:27:21,4

They have in the store attached.. food..  coffee.. and something for breakfast.. I have never been. They have car necessities:products needed like coolant, oil., an air gauge for tires. They also have Beer and wine bottles.. if you are so inclined late at night.. and live nearby. I am not that near at my office. but the time I leave.. other car washes are not open! One downside why they only got 2 stars from me is how unfriendly and unhelpful one female cashier was to me.. at night.. other times also the evening cashiers seem unintended and unfriendly in your business. Otherwise the place actually offers packaged snacks.. drinks/water to go.. the public bathrooms.. fairly well stocked and we got gas there several times during Hurricane Irma. One night cashier has been helpful in the past. I have not seen him for some time..he was older..maybe later 50' s. If I owned this place. I would fire the current bunch of employees and hire better workers.. also I would be around at night. I do not go here in the daytime.

Its possibly the largest Circle K that I've ever seen, and yet they are always out of many Polar Pop supplies. Plus, the cashier lines are often long because they're usually understaffed here. But, I pass by here frequently, so I end up stopping often for a Polar Pop &/or gas. Their gas prices are usually right on par with the average price in the area, and they have A LOT of pumps, so waiting is never an issue.

When I got to the counter I asked for my usual, he had the nerve to ask me for an ID. I asked him if he was serious or trying to be funny by carding a 56 year old person for product, have me leave this long line only to get back into with my ID. Please!

The gas price is a bit higher than other stations, such as shell and bp. But we often stop by here for convenience.

107544142720865851446,Chasity Hyatt,1,"The ""Shell"" gas station on Beach Blvd. is a horrible plc to stop for gas, they price gouge ppl on gas. And Winn Dixie rewards shouldn't contract with them, that is exactly why they raise their gas prices, so they are still getting regular price, plus whatever incentives Shell receives from Winn Dixie. Obviously they hope that ppl are dumb enough, or too inconvenienced to complain. As it's difficult enough to get in and out due to the location, and traffic..so they know much of the time ppl will jst pay and move along with their busy lives. And they aren't the only comany doing so. Also if you don't want ppl walking up to you asking for money, or change cs so they sau thwy arw short for what they were buying. And many times it's the same faces that's saying the same stories everyday in the winn dixie parking lot. NO, I dn't shop there everyday, but I have to a cpl times a wk, and family and friends mention it alot also. I give and share both.

115895580034075935528,Dr. Tachi,1,"Deplorable Customer Service.

I went to this location to get my car washed, at around 4:50 pm on October 13, and attempted to use the pay station located at the car wash entrance. When I tried to pay with my card, it was declined. Thinking it did not read my card properly the first time, I attempted again. Again, the card was declined, which I knew was impossible. I looked at my account and saw that the card had been charged twice. I went inside to tell the clerk that something may be wrong with the card reader on the machine. Instead of offering help, he abruptly said ""Nothing I can do, call your bank."" Of course, I proceeded to let him know how terrible and unacceptable his customer service skills were and asked who the owner/manager is. He said ""Joe"". I asked if ""Joe"" had a last name, to which he said he did not know. He proceeded to get progressively rude, to which I said ""Who are you talking to? Don't you EVER talk to me in that manner. You need to lower your decibels.""

I don't care if one is selling Mercedes, Bentleys or bananas at the side of the road. I don't care if you are tired, or don't feel like being at work.  If a customer is spending money at your establishment, you act as if he/she is buying a fleet of Maseratis! This sub-standard establishment will not not see a dime of my money ever.

I urge this Shell owner to employ customer service training and not employ the first individual who walks through the door. Do better. If you don't know how, quickly learn.",0x88d901eac37a4a5b:0xfb6f55852f56eb1f,2018-10-13,22:16:36,1

Nice large sized gas station and convenience store, that isn't so convenient when you have to wait 15 minutes in line, haha.

If you stop in here and the place is almost empty I am sure it will be fast to get in and out. But it seems every time I even drive by it's very busy. Funny thing is the Marathon gas station about 100 yards up the road from this location is usually never busy at all.

The upkeep and cleanliness isn’t like it use to be. There have been too many incidents involving that location that is enough for me to no longer go to there for gas or any other convenience store services. Police have even warned me about that general area. Besides being a very busy intersection for two main hwy/roads, the general area itself is considered a high drug trafficking area that adds to the many problems that have occurred at the gas station over time. They patrol and monitor the area to do the best they can to provide safety, but it is not enough to stop the problem. The store staff is friendly, but sadly that isn’t reason enough for me to continue my business at that location.",0x88dd3f9db58fb455:0xf68b5dd3511e4f6f,2019-12-11,22:36:54,1

I purchased an overpriced  defective gas can with my bank card and when I tried to return it 2 minutes later the teller told me they weren't able to give me a refund because I paid with my card. I had the teller call the manager and he said the same thing. so I told him there is no where in the store that says no refunds on merchandise. he then gave me a partial refund on the gas can stating that the taxes I paid on it already went to the government and he couldn't refund my tax on it. they are lying thieves! the place also smelled bad and was dirty.,0x88d9b1786ca0e403:0xd1596e2163e32393,2017-02-13,18:36:58,1

We looked into the store and seen a woman that was absolutely high as a kite with 2 other drug addicts coming out of the bathroom. THE STORE WAS LOCKED and they were getting high in the bathroom. She came to the door unlocked it and let the other dopeheads out of the store. She proceeded to lock the door back and say sorry and put a makeshift sign on the door saying please give me more time. This is absolutely insane that Circle K would allow this to happen. Needless to say a handful of customers walked away furious.

The roller grill and bakery case are a nice touch, as the food is delicious.  The coffee is always good, as well as the selection of fountain drinks.  This store has a limited selection of must have emergency items for out-of-towners who have forgotten essential items.  The prices are typical for that of a convenience store and fuel prices are fair, but slightly higher than that of the larger neighboring towns.

I called to get this straightened out and I got to run around. The employee I talked to told me that I had to call at 3:30 in the morning to talk to the manager. She also told me to just call my bank which I know is going to be a pain because they want me to get things straightened out with businesses I deal with first.

109759679590186567034,Aaron Garner,1,"I would like my 10.00 cash Bonnie stole from me. It is illegal to steal from your customers. When I asked for my money back, a crazy woman manager started screaming at me. I was told to come back by Bonnie because she was not trained enough to give back cash. There are no cameras on the fuel pumps so buyer be ware, this means identify thief is easy at the pump. I would think twice before stopping here. It will now end up costing this location 10 times what they stole. I ran a cash register as a kid, if your draw is 10.00 over you know you made a mistake or stole in this case. I have seen the sheriffs arrests on petty theft for less than 10.00. Why aren’t the sheriffs arresting Bonnie? Discrimination happens everyday by this company and the Pinellas county sheriffs. Thank God I recorded it. I plan to move forward against both, ACLU has taken my case. This was clearly a hate crime by both, an over reach and abuse of the power they believe they have violating all of our rights as Americans.  I am just thankful the crazy woman didn’t shoot me.

104939153347931802651,Lori Broyles,2,"Awarding plural stars seems too generous., but I read somewhere that 0-stars isn't an option, and this location deserves a small acknowledgement for its semi-friendly staff. And by ""semi-friendly"", I mean they're sympathetic when they're out of items necessary for making Polar Pops. Like cups. Or ice. Or properly carbonated fountain beverages. This store is very busy, and they're ALWAYS out of something. Or everything. In fact, I now consider it a successful visit when they're only out of ice. I've been trying to remember to bring a cup of ice from my office so I don't stew about warm soda on my drive home. I remembered today - yay me!

On a positive note, they have decent gas prices here, especially considering only one other gas station is in the immediate area, and only two are a bit further down Ulmerton (one being horrifically overpriced). The location of this Circle K keeps me coming back (prepared with my own ice, of course) - it's the closest Circle K to my office.

In any other case I would assume that the soap was out and go tell the attendant at the station and they would fix it. However on two other occasions I’ve been in this store and both bathrooms were out of order. The first time this happened I didn’t think much of it but when I came back two weeks later and noticed that same sign I knew this was intentional. These are “nickel and dime” cuts poorly run gas stations do to increase profit.

The only reason I rated them as high as AI did is because Shell Gas Rocks!!!

108965954775749142525,"John W. Bakas, Jr.",5,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION

This is the most convenient place for me to get great quality gas when I drive on I-75 from southern Hillsborough county to Pasco county.

HOW LONG AS A CUSTOMER

I have been a steady customer here for over 10 years.

GAS

It may be me, but I think I can tell when I use Shell's premium gas rather than some of the other brands (other than Chevron's premium which I also use).

STORE AND FACILITIES

The store is always clean, but smaller than most places and I think the store has no or few items for the car. It is set up for snacks and drinks.

The car wash is better than others I have used. I have never seen it out of order.  It's where I get my car washed other than at a full service car wash.

There are two rows of gas pumps that are parallel to how you drive into the place.  There are three double-sided gas pumps on each row.  A total of 12 places to stop and get gas.  At least two hoses are for diesel.

Because you don't have to make a tight turn to get to a pump like at many gas stations, I find I have to pay more attention to entering and exiting cars. It's so easy to drive onto the property and then straight to a pump (usually) or make a wide loop so the car is pointed directly towards the exit. Getting to a pump is kinda like a race car making a pit stop. I sometimes stop at a pump thinking, I need a half a turn of left-side wedge.

STAFF

On the few times I have gone into the store, the clerks have been efficient, speedy, and friendly.  They seem intent knowing what is happening in the store (good) and getting customers in and out quickly.  No complaints about the service I received.

RECOMMENDATION

For easy and quick great-quality gas when traveling on I-75 in Hillsborough county, for a nice car wash, and for a clean store and efficient staff:  5 stars.",0x88c2b798e4b3e853:0x94ef0a6a96c27844,2017-10-07,17:23:10,4

117477259621725010645,Frederico Smiliansky,1,"Huge GAS price posted outside says $2.79 ( which is already WAY more expensive than stations around here on 11/18/2019) and pump says $2.87.

There is a sticker on the pump that says Cash gets a discount, confusing. Nothing on the outdoor sign.
Ridiculous catch. Most people don’t realize that and pump the gas almost 10 cents more expensive",0x88d91940b34eeab9:0x2ad8dc4fa1bfb573,2019-11-19,00:49:45,1

116202464540837152571,Jason Hales,1,"Last night I needed a receipt for my gas purchase, since it was a business expense. I had to get it from the cashier working inside and did not know that it would be a nearly 20 minute ordeal.
I wish I caught the name of the girl working the register, but I wasn't able to. It was whoever was working 2-28-21 at 9:40 pm.
First of all, there was a long line at the register due primarily to the fact that the employee was on her personal phone at the register. When she finally began the next transaction, she continued to hold the phone up to her head and speak into it. It was then that she faced her Everest which was a primarily spanish speaking customer. She continually shouted at the man that she couldn't understand him or hear him (partially because she held a phone to her ear). Another customer had to assist with their google translate app.
I and the other customers were baffled by this employee while we were in a line nearly out the door. Finally, when it was my turn at the register, I had to repeat myself multiple times despite speaking clearly to her. The receipt she handed me was not for my purchase but someone else's. I was so annoyed with the situation that I did not bother to reenter and deal with her again. Definitely one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a Circle K and I will avoid going into this one as much as possible.",0x88dd7cc4470dc5bd:0x9b37e46c6f2d2acf,2021-03-01,14:56:17,1

I can go any time to pick up a cup of crushed ice that I love so much and since its just ice I dont get charge, or I can buy cigars with no problem... However if I go in the morning i get charged for the ice and or I get ID and I'm 46yrs old & you can clearly see im grown... Last week I went to pick up 2 cups of crushed ice, the lady charged me .54 ¢  for both cups & yesterday morning 7/31/19 andI went and picked up 2 cups of crushed ice again and the lady there then charges me .64cents for each... What really bothers me its the inconsistency with pricing... If you gonna charge, charge everyday and charge the same amount... Going into the store not knowing if you gonna get charged or how much its ridiculous... If you gonna ID for anything everyone should do it however common sense should be used... Im clearly a grown woman to be ID to buy any tabaco product... The ladies in the morning are also very rude, sarcastic and their body language irs very disrespectful and nothing its done about it at all....

This is usually my quick ""convenient"" stop before work just to fill up and go.  Because they haven't had receipt paper in the pumps for months; I always have to go in and request one.  Fuel is a business expense and I'm required to get a receipt.  I use the fuel rewards for an added discount so it's not like I don't want to just go to another gas station.  I have asked them to replace the receipt paper multiple times.  I've explained my issue to a manager.  Still no changes.  My honest guess is they don't replace the paper to force you to go inside and while you wait; you end up making purchases you normally wouldn't.  I'm all for capital gain, but when I'm ""strongly encouraged"" to make a purchase all because someone is too lazy to put receipt paper in the pump... That's not capital gain...

I went in got a handful of items and went to pay, somehow something got screwed up and the cashier didn't know how to close out the transaction. Then I was instructed to move to another pump,15 min later I was out the door. Staff has not been trained properly at all so this I blame on lack of management. This has been an ongoing problem at this location and i have had 15 or so bad experiences here and I am fed up and will never be back.

108158817352143998220,Forest Rothchild,5,Let the balancing challenge begin.  The concept of build your own stir fry is taken up a notch when you can hit the assembly line and build to infinite flavor combination.  The staff are friendly but it is always a friendly competition to see who can get most creative with the quantity that will fit in the bowl before being cooked.,0x88c2c09de34db42b:0x31dd6523dc0548d2,2018-12-16,11:54:13,4

I finally convinced my bf to go for dinner along with another friend and we were not disappointed! I have gone to other Mongolian BBQ places before and they usually have an ayce option but honestly the large bowl was filling, it's just a but challenging to get all the vegetables you want if you aren't strategic filling your bowl or if you get too much protein. Sam was awesome! I will definitely return!",0x88c2c09de34db42b:0x31dd6523dc0548d2,2017-12-31,04:02:29,4

We were seated promptly but we sat there for 10 minutes before any one came over to take our drink order.  Our meal was good but we literally had to find our server twice to get drink refills and napkins as she never came back to check on us ever.  We saw her 10 mins in for our drink order and to drop them off and then when she brought the check.

Then today, we were seated promptly again but the server took a while to come over and when she did, she walked up and said ‘how can I help you?’  Ummm ok.  I ordered our drinks and our bowls.  Selection was great and everything was fresh and clean.  We dropped it off to be cooked and this is what showed up 20 mins later.  Sausage, bacon, pepperonis,....all burnt.  I couldn’t even eat the sausage as it was rock hard.  I flagged the server down and showed her my bowl and she said ‘ok, what do you want me to do about it?’  At this point I asked for a new bowl and went and had it cooked and eventually it came out and was delicious.  Unfortunately my wife and three year old were finished by the time my meal came out so that put a damper on the evening.  Need to figure something out with the wait staff here.",0x88c2c09de34db42b:0x31dd6523dc0548d2,2019-06-22,02:46:33,4

The food was piping hot and delicious. No matter what u or taste is this place has options for you. I got the large bowl with only seafood. The white fish was a tad dry but I think some people.may like it that way. The calamari was awesome, the shrimp were awesome and the Krab was also very good. I got my money's worth for sure!! I'll be returning. The kids options are limited, there are no fries so if your kid is a fry head like mine, that's a minus. She got Mac and Cheese and it was literally that Kraft box mac.

Let them know if you have any allergies. They checked all the sauces to make sure it does not have tomatoes in them and grilled mine separately to prevent any issues. Our server marked my tag aswell to indicate allergies. The restrooms are clean and the tables are cleaned almost instantly after getting up. Drinks are delicious and I had the blue dragon.

107983370411696368436,Melinda Russek,5,This place is wonderful! I like the model of having a choice and what foods you want to the point that you even get to pick them out yourself personally with the amount of spice you want and all the ingredients you want put in your bowl and then you take it to the people who cook it for you. My food was absolutely delicious! I like my food spicy and Rich and I was able to accomplish that without any Holds Barred. So I highly recommend this for people who are picky eaters that never get enough spice and really want to have it as spicy as possible or someone who has dietary needs and needs to have specific amounts of something and very carefully measured amounts. This place is perfect for everyone! Also the drinks are delightful and the customer service is absolutely awesome!,0x88c2c09de34db42b:0x31dd6523dc0548d2,2019-07-14,20:53:35,4

I don't know what it is.  The food is great still.  Just seems like their servers need to be faster.

I have to start by saying that the portions are EXACTLY as you make them, there are people who aren’t scared to fill their bowls from here to the tipping point, but that is almost part of the fun. As a result the price is proportionate to what you add to you bowl. To me this makes the price very reasonable considering the wide variety of additions you can add to a bowl. This has to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Northdale area because it has such a unique take on the restaurant experience. They also have a great selection of drinks that have never left me disappointed and their beer selection, though limited is very affordable.

Hostess had zero personality - did not explain anything - I would say go for lunch and try it .. it’s NOT worth the dinner price !! Super disappointed! Lunch should not be $30 for an adult and a 10 year old !,0x88c2c09de34db42b:0x31dd6523dc0548d2,2019-07-10,16:23:53,1

We all filled our bowls up the way we like and gave them to the cooks. It took a little longer than usual to get our food back cooked but the cooks did have quite a few other orders.

Today we visited for our second time. We were seated rather quickly, and once again the service was average. We received our bowls and went to the line to fill them. However, when we reached the sauces, there was no Mongolian BBQ sauce. I asked if they had any to bring out to the line, but they said they didn't have any. It's frustrating, as I have celiac disease and can't eat gluten. There are only 3 gluten-free sauces available and Mongolian BBQ is the one I prefer above the rest. It was a little disappointing not being informed ahead of time that the MONGOLIAN grille was out of MONGOLIAN BBQ sauce. We had already filled our bowls with meat and veggies, it was too late to decide to leave. I got the garlic water sauce and it was alright, but not what I came for. I just would have appreciated if our server had informed us of the lack of Mongolian BBQ sauce ahead of time.",0x88c2c09de34db42b:0x31dd6523dc0548d2,2017-11-07,20:03:40,1

The food was pretty good but I wasn't crazy about the beef...it seemed pretty tough to me. But the veggies and sauces were great so it would be worth it for me to go back and try it with another protein.

104731074562377278239,Mike Humes,2,So I went here with my family and expected something really good. Not so much for what the place could be. We waited at the unmanned seating station for 5 minutes when finally someone came over to seat us. We said we have 4 people eating and one not eating (a 4 year old). So the person sat us at a table for 4. Our server had to move us so we could all sit. The food tasted good and everyone was nice. For the medium bowls they gave us 2 tortillas. Now I dont know anyone who could fit all that food into 2 tortillas and we had to ask for cheese which they promptly brought in tiny little containers like it was caviar so we had to ask for more and more tortillas which then in turn took them about 15 minutes to get to the table. Naturally all of our food was then cold so I ask for the check and low and behold the dreaded tortillas that destroyed our meal was on the bill at a modest dollar each for the 4.  So for lack of a timely delivery of about a dollars worth of tortillas (about a dozen) we wont waste our time with this place again. Honestly there are places out there who want your business and do their best to earn it. I paid the bill and we left disappointed.,0x88c2c09de34db42b:0x31dd6523dc0548d2,2017-11-13,05:24:31,3

Many proteins, veggies, and sauces to choose from. And then when you bring your bowl to the grill, you pick your starches. My bowl came out pretty good. I got a mix of the shredded beef, scallops, shrimps and imitation crab meat with spinach, bean sprouts, mushrooms and broccoli. I went with the Khan Pao sauce.

The pwople there arw amazing. I asked to move somewhere else, because I dont like my back to a door. With no questions, they moved me. Ice got ptsd and they were accommodating qithout making me feel weird about it. They are great with allergies, too.
You get to actually watch your food go from the raw, fresh state, to the finished dish. The guys on the grill make a huge show of it. Its worth it just to watch the pyrotechnics.

I placed a to go order last week and didn’t get it until 40 minutes after the requested time. I wish it was a one time thing but it’s happened repeatedly.

The staff is as warm and inviting as cardboard....on the attentive scale with only 4 other tables of people I give a 6 out of 10.This being our first time I give the food a 10! We enjoyed this place enough to come back again. The only major issue I have with this place is if you are not into rap you're stuck with having to listen to stuff that you might not want your kids hearing since what was being played contained vulgar language and summer other derogatory things. Now I know some people will say why didn't you say anything but the truth of the matter is it's better sometimes to just Kum & Go when it comes to people in your food then it is to cause an issue. After three long days of Busch Gardens walking 20000 plus steps can being tired I just didn't have the desire to do anything more than eat and go back to the room.,0x88c2ce6c7b7053fb:0x87756709cc7965d,2020-12-30,14:33:17,2

We got to the restaurant to get our curbside order. I called & they said they were going to bring it out. 15 minutes later, I had to call again & after a few minutes on hold,  they told me my order had been given to a door dasher & they were starting another order that would be ready in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later, I called to check on my order again. They said it was on its way out right then. 8 minutes later, I was calling again to cancel my order (45 minutes was a bit long to have to wait) & they came out the door with our food. I know things happen & I don't blame them for that. I just wish I'd known from the get go that the order was missing. I'd already been waiting almost 20 minutes before they re-started my order.

All I wanted was a bowl. Kind of crazy a personal issue with an employee stopped a party of 12 from eating there. I also watched my sister in law slip and fall inside next to the door on the wet floor since it was raining all day and nobody even tried to dry the floor, they took zero precautions to dry the floor or even put caution signs up.

I had bulgogi pork, steak, and chicken breast with all my favorite veges then stir fried with rice noodles (gluten free) with several sauces I'd selected. There were closed to 20 sauces to give you almost any flavor profile you're in the mood for. Also some dry spice blends and fresh herbs.  You could do plain as you like and one of our group seated only chicken and rice..  My daughter tried scallops and tofu with udon noodles and said it was perfect for her. All of us agreed our meal was really fresh and good.  The server was helpful and checked on us often and refilled drinks. They look to have a full bar although we stuck with tea and soda.

The restaurant is still dirty and the condiment station was filthy. There was a couple of woman that came in with kids and the one teenager was stirring the ladel for no reason then she was leaning over where you put your bowls for the kitchen to start cooking it and had no mask on. I informed the manager, but she didn't want to start a confrontation since it was about an hour before closing. Anyway I was very disappointed with that and became very anxious because the kids and adults were all over the place piling there food as high as can be.

On the downside, the restaurant feels a bit sticky/slidy (floors are not as clean as other places, menus and tables can be sticky or have residue). I do see the staff trying to keep it clean, but maybe they need a new cleaning product or degreaser or something... Not sure, just not as clean as a an equivalent restaurant for the price (olive garden, carrabba's or outback).",0x88c2ce6c7b7053fb:0x87756709cc7965d,2020-11-29,22:39:14,1

You then fill your bowl with whatever Meats vegetables fruits seasonings Etc that you like. You then fill a separate container with whatever sauce you would like and there are many to choose from. I personally love the sweet garlic and my son loves the Teriyaki which also is very good. Then you take everything up to the grill masters and let them know what do you want them to grill this with you have a choice of rice or noodles. Also let them know if you want eggs included and if you have allergies to anyting.  They Grill it up together and within a few minutes you have a very fresh hot delicious meal! Now I understand why he loves it so much and I will go as often as I definitely will be a regular customer now! This is also a great choice if you're worried about going to restaurants during this pandemic because it's very clean and tables are marked for social distancing.

As a first timer, the concept was a bit confusing. Could have been explained to us a little better. Also, we were a party of 5, since the restaurant was so loud we couldn’t hear the server when she was walking us through the food bar.

Basically you select a bowl size. Then you pack it with as much raw meats and veggies as you’d like. Then they cook it for you. Based on your bowl size you select how many servings of rice, noodles, etc. are added to your bowl. You also have the option of adding an egg. Food was good.

I mentioned my allergy up front, ordered some rice and a drink.  The server was very polite and understanding and made sure that I was taken care of. The rice was cooked well, no burning or lumpiness.  My friends both enjoyed their different dishes as well.

Garbage on the floor, under the tables, on the tables. There are dividers between sections, they look like it's been forever since they were dusted. Our server was kind of attentive, poorly trained, actually I don't think training is of any importance here. She did ask 6-7 times if we were ready to order our bowls, even though we told her repeatedly that we were waiting for more people. Then in the small area we were in they sat a group, at least 12-14 high school kids, screaming and yelling. It was not pleasant. Food was ok, couldn't enjoy it. Never saw anyone that was a supervisor or manager, the only person that inquired as to how everything was was a busboy.

Dinner adult bowls are $10, and if you fill them right, there should be enough for almost any appetite to take some home - pile it on! Kids bowls are $6 including a drink and are bottomless. (Prices subject to change.)

It's a great deal and the food is excellent. There are a ton of ingredients to choose from. We have a nut allergy in our family, and the people at the grill are prepared to deal with that sort of thing. They have a special cards they use to distinguish your food to make sure there are no mistakes.

Our server was Adam, and he was awesome. He walked us through what to do since we had never been there before. Before we left, we met Alex, the manager, and he was very nice, as well. All in all, we had a great experience there and we will definitely be going back.",0x88c2ce6c7b7053fb:0x87756709cc7965d,2012-06-18,21:15:26,4

I was standing there helping my own kids so I gently informed him that it is a one-use stick. Seems like that could happen a lot which is pretty gross.  I'm kind of surprised that cross-contamination doesn't happen more often. Also some suggested flavor combos would be helpful.

There was a variety of meats, vegetables, seasonings, and sauces which was a little overwhelming as I wasn't sure what flavor combos would go well together. After we had eaten we noticed some little recipe cards which would've been nice for our server to tell us about. It was slow though so I was able to kinda fumble around for awhile. I wouldn't have survived if it was busy in there.

Sticky tongs to get the chicken kinda grossed me out. Thankfully there were wet naps and hand sanitizer available at the cooking station. I was standing there like an idiot before our server finally noticed me and told me she would bring the food to us.

The end result was good and l'll probably go back now that I have a clue.....",0x88c2ce6c7b7053fb:0x87756709cc7965d,2017-06-20,17:33:28,3

113885046052918272273,Ms. Pat,2,"The food was great.  I really enjoyed building my entree with the flavors I chose. I gave 4 stars because I did ask questions that should've been an indication this was my 1st time here so the waitress could've given a little more guidance. Also once we received our food she never checked back with us if we need anything (refills, how's the food, ect). I will go back.

UPDATE:  A bit disappointed after my recent visit on 8/30/18 after finding a piece of sharp metal in my food from cleaning the grill (that made it in my mouth, I was enjoying my meal until then)... (I know accidents can happen but the cleaning practice needs to be reviewed. After scrubbing, rinse and wipe or something to help avoid this in the future.) The manager initially apologized and asked if I still wanted to eat my food or make another one. I hesitated (in disbelief), then said I'll make a new one. Then when I gave my new order and asked for it to go he said ""I'll give you 20% off"" I said ok and went to my seat. The server came and said the manager was giving me a discount I said ""don't you do military discount here"" she said yes I asked well is he going to give me my military 20% and the 20% he  just offered me. So she went to ask. He came back and said he was giving both. Military was $5.47 (I think, not looking at the receipt right now) and his was $3.00.

I still enjoy their food minus the metal but it'll be a while before I go back after this experience.  I did eat my food very carefully the next day, so I didn't enjoy it as well as I was being over cautious with each bite.

Attached is a picture of the metal I bit into. I took this picture waiting for the manager to come to the table. It was so sharp that it was sticking in to my finger very easily.",0x88c2ce6c7b7053fb:0x87756709cc7965d,2018-09-01,10:57:20,4

112473897166272802836,Dan Strickland,2,"UPDATE AS OF OCT 31,2020
My Girlfriend and I decided to have dinner this evening at your restaurant. We were greeted and seated promptly and told that someone would be with us shortly. However, we sat for approximately 6 mins before someone even as much took our drink order, and that was after one young lady took the initiative and asked us if anyone has been with us yet?  The restaurant was not at all busy there were several severs standing at the host stand and standing at the Bar area NOT doing anything. She  seemed agitated and went and asked a couple of servers who was going to take that table? Finally we had a server come over to take our order.  He seemed like he just didn't wanna be there, disconnected, completely unmotivated. After he took our order things proceeded as it should. The meal was cooked  and very delicious, came out quick.

The only other issue we had was that during our meal we sat and stared at a dirty table right in front of us. It sat dirty from the time we arrived and it along with other tables around us stayed dirty. I don't see why this should be because the restaurant was not busy at all. The table that sat dirty in front of us, we watched the server come by pick up his cash tip from the table then come back later and grabbed the receipt from the same table crumble it up and Tossed it back onto the table and never once bussing that table. We did not see anyone bussing this or any other tables until we were ready to leave and that was a lady manager I believe. We also observed that none of your servers seemed cordial or motivated aside from what was absolutely necessary to be done.

I have dined here before in the past and service was always on point. This is a very sad decline and makes me wonder if we should dine here again in the future?",0x88c2ce6c7b7053fb:0x87756709cc7965d,2020-11-01,09:55:17,1

The next time, not quite as good and the service wasnt either. We had to flag people down every time we needed anything, including refills.  No one checks on you after you get the food. Another time, the waitress dumped my whole hot bowl of food all over my shoulder, arm and WHITE blouse. Ruined my evening out as I couldnt exactly go out on the town as I planned, smelly and stained. I was apologised to (understandably things happen) then handed a new bowl... but no discount even on the meal. That was an extra step that most other places would take to try to make up for MY inconvenience.
This last time was our final straw... The food tasted terrible. It was burnt and the place smelled like an old filthy mop bucket (if you have ever worked in a resturaunt you know what I am talking about). But when we asked to remake our bowls, and told the cook the issue... It happened again! We watched him leave the food without flipping it and moving it around. I hope management steps it up and puts some emphasis on training these people to do better at customer service.",0x88c2ce6c7b7053fb:0x87756709cc7965d,2017-12-01,22:09:56,2

That being said, 3rd time they didn't use the sauce we brought, our food was dry and they lied about it. 4th time...you have to circle eggs on the ticket if you want them. Hubby allergic, didn't circle (obviously) but he got eggs. To top that off they took his bowl put everything back on grill and picked out the eggs. REALLY!? Do these people even know what an allergy is??? That is unacceptable. However we thought we'd give them another shot. Waited over 10 mins with no service. Server after server plus hostesses walking by and we had to flag someone down. How long does it take to acknowledge a group in your section??? And she had the audacity to follow us to the font and tell us she knows how to do her job...REALLY!? If she knew how to do her job then why were we leaving??? Never did see a manager in the place. Bad service. Hostesses should be trained in setting a table with drinks and bowls especially if it's a repeat customer. Waitresses with attitudes that have no idea how to talk to a customer and should NEVER follow one to the door to argue. I miss the Dish and wish BD's Mongolian Bbq would set up shop here.

They have a smaller amount of pumps compared to some other brand gas stations nearby, but never struggled to get a spot. The store is kept clean and been quick to get through - nice after a long day!

Again, we are delayed - the supplier blamed. One can only put up with so many excuses or failures to perform.

“We are not A TEAM because we work together. WE ARE a team because We Respect, trust, and care for each other.” is their mantra.

By each other, they mean intercompany - not the customer.

We trust that we can hold them hostage.

101760890352978055673,Jeremy Blaise,2,"The process and customer service need a lot of work at this company. We recently purchased our home and were unaware of how the propane account worked. Unexpectedly, we ran out of propane in the middle of the day on a Tuesday (the gauge was still at 80%). Called Ferrellgas at 3:15pm. It was at that point that I learned we needed to first set up a new account as our leased tank was still in the former owner’s name. Once a new account is established, they can then set up a time for someone to first come out and test the system (easy way for them to get more money out of their customers). After that is done, they can then schedule a separate appointment for someone to come out and deliver propane. When I asked how long the process would take, there were crickets – seriously, the people on the phone have no answers for timing. I pressed the woman on the phone asking if we were talking about days, weeks, or months, and she reluctantly told me that they could probably get us up and running by the end of the week.

Note once again, it was 3:15 on a Tuesday - however, it was apparently too late in the day for them to schedule me for a system check. I don’t even mean to have someone come out that same day. Literally, it was too late in the day to SCHEDULE an appointment. They would need to call me the next morning.

Annoyed with the situation and already envisioning the next several days (our hot water and range run off propane) I set up the account and moved on. I waited for a call the next morning to “schedule an appointment” and finally around 10:45am I called to find out why I hadn’t been called. I received a call back at 11:30 that someone would be out that afternoon, but the timing was unknown. By 12:30 a very nice gentleman showed up, tested the system, added four gallons of propane, showed me a few things, and was gone within 30 minutes.

I then called to schedule delivery of the full tank. I was told they would request delivery immediately, but again, there were zero answers as to timing – could be hours, days, weeks, or months for all I know.
But by the next morning, the truck was at our house and gave us a full tank.

If, from the moment I called, the customer service person could put me at ease that they could have someone out the next day who would put in a few gallons of propane as part of the test and that would hold us over until the full tank delivery within another day or two, my perception of this company would be so much different. Instead, as a new customer, I am anything but thrilled to be using them.

They get two stars instead of one because the people I interacted with were extremely nice - they just had zero answers.",0x88df29e1143fcbc5:0xa6bc725e2bb9547c,2018-02-08,15:40:57,4

109654513929696332490,Jose Liscano,1,"This gas station continues to be the worst the car wash is constantly breaking down and washes poorly, then when you are require to get a new code the attendants are completely lost on procedures to refund money or re issue a new code. When purchasing a car wash thru the pump station the machine never has paper to print either the car wash code or gas purchased poorly maintained ...key pads don't work after swiping Chevron card  . Have complaint several times to the manager or attendant and goes thru deaf ears they just don't care for customer experience or service. SHAME ON CHEVRON  for for not listening and not following up to these reviews  especially with a 1.9 rating getting tired of the same issues changing to the gas station across the street and cancelling my accounts. Pumps are slow as ever, usually in the mornings sometimes as much as 30 mins to fueled a 10 gal tank. Complaint to the sation attendants... as this is a  constant situation at this station and  stated that they know about the problem but there is nothing that they could do.  Other issues are the lack of receipt paper at the pumps.  Car wash regularly breaks down.   Do not buy the car wash at the pump...  pump station almost never gives you a receipt with the car wash code making you waste time in line to get a receipt from the attendant and only to find out that when you enter the code at the car wash panel the system is broken. Again!!! making you make another trip to the attendant who almost never knows how to give you a refund for the car wash or give you a receipt with another code for a later day. The attendant's have no training at all on how  to deal with these situations.  Be prepare to waste your time.  I wish Chevron would develop an electronic receipt sent via email or text with the car wash code so you don't have to deal with this regular problem.
